# Book Manager
This Python program implements a MySQL book database that allows users to search, add, and remove books based on certain criteria. The program requires quite a bit of setup to be able to run. You will need both the latest version of Python and MySQL. You will also need to use pip to download the mysql-connector-python packages. You can use this tutorial to do so: https://pynative.com/install-mysql-connector-python/

Download and run instructions:
1. Download the Book-Manager Repository and extract to your desired location.
2. Create a new database in MySQL called 'bookmanager', and open the SQL schema into the database. You may need to open mysql-connector.py and change the connection information.
3. Run menu.py by opening the file in a python editor and clicking the compile/execute button.
4. There will be a list of options that you can chose from. Type in the number of the option, and press enter.
5. Each option will have instructions with the format of the input.
6. When you're ready to quit the program, type 6 and press enter.
